Frozen vegetables: These are a convenient and nutritious option for adding vegetables to your meals. They can be used in stir-fries, soups, or as a side dish.\n\n2. Granola bars: Look for granola bars that are made with vegan ingredients, such as nuts, seeds, and dried fruits. They make a great on-the-go snack or a quick breakfast option.\n\n3. Whole wheat bread: Opt for whole wheat bread that is free from animal products, such as honey or dairy. It can be used for sandwiches, toast, or as a base for avocado toast.\n\nThese items should provide a good foundation for your vegan diet. Remember to check labels and ingredients to ensure they are vegan-friendly."}
